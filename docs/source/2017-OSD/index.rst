Open Source Day 2017 with Jupyter
=================================

.. important::

   **Before the event**

    The Grace Hopper Celebration is a busy, vibrant event. We know you are busy. 
    Since conference wifi can be spotty, please setup your laptop (if possible)
    before Open Source Day.

    - Install `Anaconda for Python 3.6 <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_
    - Install a favorite code editor (see recommendations in set up if you don't have a favorite)
    - Create a GitHub account
    - Install git
    - Optional (or if you have difficulty installing Anaconda):

        - Install `nteract <https://nteract.io>`_ (a one-click install for notebooks on the desktop)
        - Sign up for the free `Microsoft Azure notebooks <https://notebooks.azure.com>`_
          (notebooks in the cloud)

    For detailed instructions, see :doc:`Set up and configuration </2017-OSD/set-up>`.
