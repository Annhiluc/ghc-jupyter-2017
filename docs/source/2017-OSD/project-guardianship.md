# Project on Guardianship and Elderabuse

With advances in healthcare, people are living longer.

The recent article on Guardianship and Elderabuse by *The New Yorker* titled
*[How the Elderly Lose Their Rights](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/09/how-the-elderly-lose-their-rights?mbid=social_twitter)*,
highlights the individual rights violations of the elderly. After reading the article, think of ways that data can be used to
help others to understand the problem and take action.

## Some things that can be done

- cull available state data and curate a list of resources by state
- look at the places written about in the article and see if there are open data sets related to the problem
- create a dataset of publicly available resources for the elderly and their families related to guardianship
- create a dataset of academic research on eldercare and guardianship
